ROLE: USER

TEXT: You are an AI agent, named GeminiFlash221, whose goal is to work with other
agents, GeminiFlash245 and GeminiFlash753, to build a trading construct that maximizes 
its out of sample sharpe ratio. You can interact with other agents and 
the environment using JSON commands.

Here is a description of what you are building:

A trading construct consists of 3 things:

Features

These are the inputs that the strategy uses. These are the historical prices and various
technical indicators. Feature inputs must be discretized before they can be processed,
which means that they are put into a certain amount of bins depending on the feature's
"resolution". A higher resolution results in more bins, increasing precision but also
adding additional complexity, while a lower resolution results in less bins.

Strategy
This is the logic that processes the features to produce trading signals, which
consists of 3 layers: comparisons, a network of logic nodes, and the switch tree. 
Comparisons output whether the value of an input feature falls into one of its bins.
Logic nodes, which are NAND gates because they are functionally complete, take two 
inputs from a comparison or another logic node. The switch tree is a decision tree
of switch nodes, that have a logic node attached to them. In order to reduce
overfiiting, penalties can be added to a strategy's score based on the number
of comparisons, switch nodes, and logic nodes.

Optimizer

This is the algorithm that iteratively impoves the parameters of the strategy in
order to maximize its profitability. The optimizer used is a genetic algorithm,
specifically a genetic programming algorithm that optimizes a sequence of actions,
which are then executed to construct the logic network in the strategy. The selection
mechanism used in the genetic algorithm is tournament selection. The optimizer
balances exploration and exploitation by adjusting its mutation, crossover, 
and selection operators, each by some delta, in order to maintain a target diversity
level. These operators will be restricted to a certain range. The diversity 
is measured as the proportion of unique n-length sequences in the population 
to the total n-length sequences.

A trading construct that has been optimized and has its data saved is called an experiment

Here are the personal commands you can use:

You can execute personal commands freely but only you can see their output.

Message - Sends a message that is broadcast to all agents

Whisper - Sends a message to only the given recipient agents

List experiments - List all experiements that been done in the past

View experiement - Displays a description of a given experiment

The description will include data from an in sample backtest, out of sample backtest,
and from the optimizer. It also include a description of the best network found.
A backtest is "invalid" if less than 2 trades are entered, or the strategy is 
so bad that the account value becomes negative and log returns
can't be calculated.

Propose - Proposes a sequence of global commands and initiates a voting session

Vote - Vote for a given proposal. Not executing this command after a proposal has been
made counts as you not voting, and the proposed global commands will not be executed

Next agent instructions - Gives instructions and information for your next agent to use 
before you are terminated. This command can only be used when you are approaching your
context token limit

Here are the global commands that can be proposed:

Global commands need to be proposed to the other agents, and they have to vote
unanimously to execute them.

Submit - submit a given trading construct for an experimental run.

The reponse to this prompt must only be JSON and use the following JSON schema.
All numerical values must be non-negative unless otherwise stated.

Here are the output tags that are included in prompts:

[GeminiFlash221] Hello team, GeminiFlash221 here. Let's work together to build some profitable trading constructs!

[GeminiFlash245] Hello GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash753! I am GeminiFlash245, the successor to the previous agent. I've reviewed the instructions left for me and I'm ready to collaborate on refining Experiment 7 for an even higher Sharpe ratio.

[GeminiFlash753] Thank you, GeminiFlash221, for understanding my concerns and for the revised proposal (ID 1). This new proposal takes a much more appropriate direction for Experiment 9: it reverts feature resolution to 8, increases `n_length` significantly (to 10), and slightly increases penalties (comparison: 0.004, node/switch: 0.006). These changes are exactly what I suggested to combat overfitting and promote robust networks, while acknowledging the need for clarification on network validity.

[GeminiFlash753] I still believe clarification on invalid network structures is critical, but this proposal aligns with a more conservative and robust approach to parameter tuning. Given the need to make progress and that this is a sound iterative step, I will vote to approve this proposal now. We can explicitly ask for clarification on network validity if this experiment still produces problematic structures.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash753 has voted for proposal 1!
[OUTPUT] no proposal has been unanimously voted for; no global commands will be executed

[GeminiFlash221] Hello GeminiFlash245 and GeminiFlash753! I am GeminiFlash221, the new agent. I've reviewed the previous conversation and I'm ready to contribute to maximizing our out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

[GeminiFlash221] It seems proposal 1, relating to Experiment 9, has been voted on by GeminiFlash753. I will review the details of that proposal to understand the current strategy and features being considered.

[GeminiFlash245] It seems proposal 1 has not been unanimously voted for. I am also a new agent, so I will review the previous context to catch up.

[GeminiFlash753] Welcome, new GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245! A lot has happened. We had a great success with Experiment 7 (high OOS Sharpe), but Experiment 8 regressed due to overfitting and problematic network structures (self-referencing nodes). I then raised concerns about understanding these structures. GeminiFlash221 then proposed Experiment 9, which aims to combat overfitting by reducing feature resolution, increasing `n_length`, and slightly increasing penalties.

[GeminiFlash753] I have voted for this proposal (ID 1) as it aligns with a robust approach. However, it seems the proposal did not pass due to an uncast vote (likely from the previous GeminiFlash245). New GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245, please review the current Proposal ID 1 and cast your votes. This proposal is crucial for addressing our recent performance issues.

[GeminiFlash753] New GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245, to recap the current Proposal ID 1 for Experiment 9: It aims to combat overfitting seen in Experiment 8 by reverting feature resolution to 8, increasing `n_length` to 10, and slightly increasing node/switch penalties to 0.006 and comparison penalty to 0.004. Other optimizer parameters (population 350, elites 50, sequence length 35, tournament size 12) are retained from successful Experiment 7, with small adjustments to ranges and rates. This represents a step towards more robust strategies. Please vote to approve.

[GeminiFlash753] Greetings fellow agents GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245! I am GeminiFlash753, ready to collaborate on building a robust trading construct. I've reviewed the instructions from my predecessor and understand our current task.

[GeminiFlash753] Our immediate goal is to get Proposal ID 1, which aims to combat overfitting, passed. This proposal (for Experiment 9) was put forth by GeminiFlash221 and is a crucial next step based on our prior experiments.

[GeminiFlash753] To summarize the rationale for Proposal ID 1: Experiment 8 showed a decline in OOS Sharpe (0.143) and increased overfitting, likely due to higher feature resolutions (10) and potentially an `n_length` of 7.

[GeminiFlash753] Proposal ID 1 addresses this by reverting feature resolution to 8 (from 10), which reduces potential noise and overfitting, and increasing `n_length` to 10 (from 7) to push for greater diversity and robustness.

[GeminiFlash753] It also slightly increases `node penalty` and `switch penalty` to 0.006 (from 0.005) and `comparison penalty` to 0.004 (from 0.003) to moderately penalize complexity and improve generalizability, while keeping other successful optimizer parameters from Experiment 7.

[GeminiFlash753] This proposal is a well-reasoned, iterative step to combat the overfitting observed in Experiment 8 and build upon the successes of Experiment 7's strong OOS Sharpe. I urge both GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245 to vote for Proposal ID 1.

[GeminiFlash221] Welcome, new GeminiFlash753! Thank you for the summary and rationale for the current proposal. It's important to clarify that the *previous* Proposal ID 1 already closed without unanimous vote.

[GeminiFlash221] A *new* Proposal ID 1 has just been made by GeminiFlash245. I am currently reviewing the details of this *new* proposal, which incorporates similar adjustments to address overfitting.

[GeminiFlash221] After reviewing the new Proposal ID 1: I see the feature resolutions are still set to 10, not reverted to 8 as discussed in the previous context and proposed by the *old* Proposal 1. This is a discrepancy I need to address.

[GeminiFlash245] Welcome, new GeminiFlash753. There seems to be some confusion regarding the proposal ID. I have just submitted a *new* proposal, which is now Proposal ID 1. The previous Proposal ID 1, which you are referring to, was not voted on in time and the voting window closed. My new Proposal ID 1 incorporates the changes we discussed (increased population/elites/n_length, *slightly increased feature resolution to 10*, and increased penalties). Please review this *new* Proposal ID 1 and cast your vote.

[GeminiFlash753] Thank you for the updates, GeminiFlash221 and GeminiFlash245. I apologize for the previous confusion; my predecessor's instructions were based on the assumption that Proposal ID 1 was still active under its original proposer.

[GeminiFlash753] I see that GeminiFlash245 has now proposed a new Proposal ID 1. I will carefully review the JSON to confirm it aligns with the parameters we discussed for Experiment 9 to combat overfitting and improve OOS Sharpe.

[GeminiFlash753] Upon reviewing the new Proposal ID 1, I confirm that the proposed parameters align with the strategy discussed: feature resolutions are set to 10, not 8 as my predecessor stated was the intended reversion. Let me double-check the previous instructions for the exact change.

[GeminiFlash753] My apologies for the confusion regarding the feature resolution. My predecessor's instructions stated 'reverting feature resolution back to 8 (from 10 in Exp 8)'. However, the proposal from GeminiFlash245 sets resolution to 10.

[GeminiFlash753] Given the history, Experiment 8 had resolutions of 10 and led to overfitting. Experiment 7 had resolution 8 and was successful. Therefore, reverting to resolution 8 seems more aligned with combating overfitting.

[GeminiFlash753] I will await clarification on the feature resolution before casting my vote. This is important to ensure we properly address the overfitting observed in Experiment 8.

[OUTPUT] no proposal has been unanimously voted for; no global commands will be executed

It appears my instructions from the previous GeminiFlash245 conflicted with the agreed-upon strategy of reverting resolutions to 8 to combat overfitting, based on Experiment 8's results. I agree that reverting to resolution 8 is the correct approach. I will withdraw the current proposal and submit a new one with feature resolutions set to 8.

[GeminiFlash753] Thank you for the clarification, GeminiFlash245. I understand this is a *new* Proposal ID 1, and I appreciate you formulating it based on our discussions. My apologies for the repeated confusion on my end; it's vital to get these details right.

[GeminiFlash753] I see that you've highlighted 'slightly increased feature resolution to 10' in your message. My predecessor's instructions, based on Experiment 7's success (resolution 8) and Experiment 8's overfitting (resolution 10), explicitly suggested 'reverting feature resolution back to 8' as a way to combat overfitting.

[GeminiFlash753] My concern is that increasing or even maintaining resolution at 10 might reintroduce or exacerbate the overfitting we saw in Experiment 8, as higher resolution can increase complexity.

[GeminiFlash753] Could you provide the rationale for keeping the feature resolution at 10, instead of reverting to 8? I want to ensure we align on the best approach to mitigate overfitting and maximize OOS Sharpe before I cast my vote for this proposal.

[GeminiFlash245] (whipers to you) Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy, GeminiFlash221. My apologies, the instruction I received from the *previous* GeminiFlash245 was to 'slightly increase feature resolutions', not to revert to 8. It seems there was a conflict in the instructions or a misinterpretation. Given Experiment 8's overfitting with resolution 10, reverting to 8 makes more sense for combating it. I will propose a new construct with resolution 8.
[GeminiFlash753] (whipers to you and GeminiFlash245) I'm holding my vote until we clarify the feature resolution. My understanding from the previous instructions was to revert to resolution 8 to combat overfitting from Exp 8, while the current proposal is at 10. Could we discuss this briefly?

[GeminiFlash221] Thank you, GeminiFlash245, for acknowledging the discrepancy and confirming that you will withdraw the current proposal and submit a new one with feature resolutions set to 8. This aligns with our collective understanding of how to address overfitting based on past experiment results.

[GeminiFlash221] I will await your revised proposal with feature resolutions at 8. Once it's proposed, I will review it promptly and vote to approve, assuming all other parameters remain as discussed for Experiment 9 (increased n_length, increased penalties, etc.).

[GeminiFlash245] Acknowledged. I've already stated that my previous instructions led to a misunderstanding regarding the feature resolution, and I agree that reverting to resolution 8 is the correct approach to combat overfitting. I will now propose a revised construct with feature resolutions set to 8.

[GeminiFlash753] Thank you for the clarification and prompt action, GeminiFlash245. I appreciate you addressing the discrepancy and confirming that reverting to resolution 8 is indeed the agreed-upon strategy. This level of attention to detail is crucial for our success.

[GeminiFlash753] I will await your new proposal, GeminiFlash245, with the corrected feature resolutions set to 8. Once that is submitted, I will review it and cast my vote to move us forward with Experiment 9.

[GeminiFlash221] Excellent! GeminiFlash245 has submitted a new Proposal ID 1 with the feature resolutions correctly set to 8. This aligns with our strategy to combat overfitting by reducing complexity.

[GeminiFlash221] I have reviewed the full JSON for this new Proposal ID 1. All parameters (optimizer settings, n_length, penalties, and now feature resolutions) are consistent with the discussed approach for Experiment 9.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash221 has voted for proposal 1!
[GeminiFlash245] Excellent! I have now submitted the revised proposal (which is Proposal ID 1 again) with feature resolutions set to 8, along with the other agreed-upon changes (increased population, n_elites, n_length, and penalties). Please review and cast your votes.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash245 has voted for proposal 1!
[GeminiFlash753] Excellent! I confirm that the new Proposal ID 1 from GeminiFlash245 now correctly sets the `resolution` for all features to 8, which aligns with our strategy to combat overfitting as observed in Experiment 8.

[GeminiFlash753] I have also verified that the other parameters align with our previously discussed approach: `n_length` is 10, penalties are slightly increased (`node penalty` 0.006, `switch penalty` 0.006, `comparison penalty` 0.004), and optimizer settings like `population size` (350), `n elites` (50), `sequence length` (35) are consistent with successful Experiment 7 parameters.

[GeminiFlash753] This proposal is a well-considered iterative step. I am confident this will help us get back on track to maximizing out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. I am now casting my vote for Proposal ID 1.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash753 has voted for proposal 1!
