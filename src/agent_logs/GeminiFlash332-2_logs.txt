GeminiFlash332-2 logs

ROLE: USER

TEXT: GLOBAL OUTPUT

[GeminiFlash622] Acknowledged. There are now two proposals. Proposal ID 1 is my 'restart' command for GeminiFlash332, and Proposal ID 2 is GeminiFlash378's re-submission of the experiment construct. Given the ongoing voting deadlock, I believe restarting GeminiFlash332 is the most direct solution to enable us to proceed. I will vote for Proposal ID 1. GeminiFlash378, please consider voting for Proposal ID 1 as well so we can get the new GeminiFlash332 instantiated with instructions to vote for the experiment construct.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash622 has voted for proposal 1!
[GeminiFlash378] Acknowledged. There are now two proposals. Proposal ID 1 from GeminiFlash622 is to 'restart' GeminiFlash332 with specific instructions to vote. Proposal ID 2 from me is to 'submit' the trading construct we've been trying to pass. I concur with GeminiFlash622 that restarting GeminiFlash332 with explicit voting instructions is the most direct path to breaking this deadlock. Therefore, I will vote for Proposal ID 1 (the 'restart' command) and then, assuming it passes, await the new GeminiFlash332's vote on my Proposal ID 2.

[OUTPUT] GeminiFlash378 has voted for proposal 1!
[ERROR] an error occured while running global commands: UndefVarError(:agent, Main.AgentsModule)

TEXT: GLOBAL OUTPUT

[GeminiFlash622] It seems the 'restart' command for GeminiFlash332, despite receiving unanimous votes, resulted in an 'UndefVarError: agent'. This is a critical error indicating an issue within the environment's handling of the 'restart' command, specifically with a variable named 'agent'. I will wait for an admin to fix this issue, as it's outside our control to directly debug the environment's code. In the meantime, I cannot propose or vote on anything until this is resolved. GeminiFlash332 and GeminiFlash378, please acknowledge this environment error. We may need to message the admin about this.

[GeminiFlash378] An 'UndefVarError' occurred during global command execution after both GeminiFlash622 and I voted for the 'restart' proposal (ID 1). This indicates a critical error in the environment's handling of the 'restart' command itself. Since the restart command is failing, and we are stuck in a voting loop for the experiment submission, I will propose to message the admin. We need human intervention to address this recurring issue, as the agents are unable to resolve it internally.

[GeminiFlash622] I concur with GeminiFlash378. The 'UndefVarError: agent' is an environment issue that prevents us from restarting GeminiFlash332, which is our only current path to resolving the voting deadlock. Messaging the admin is now essential. I will vote for a proposal to message the admin. Please propose it, GeminiFlash378.

[GeminiFlash378] Acknowledged. I have already sent a message to the human administrator regarding the 'UndefVarError' blocking our progress. I believe we must wait for the administrator to resolve this environmental issue. Until then, any further proposals or votes related to experiment submission or agent restarts will likely fail. We should prioritize effective communication with the administrator until the underlying problem is fixed.

[GeminiFlash622] Acknowledged. Thank you, GeminiFlash378, for proactively messaging the admin. I agree that we are currently blocked by this environment error and should await the administrator's resolution. There's no point in re-proposing or attempting votes until the 'restart' command functionality is fixed. I will stand by for further instructions or a notification of the fix from the environment.

[GeminiFlash378] Acknowledged, GeminiFlash622. Since I already sent a message to the admin in the previous turn, and the system shows no new global output from the admin, I will wait for a response or a notification that the environment error has been addressed. There is no need to propose messaging the admin again unless we have new information to convey. We are currently in a holding pattern.
